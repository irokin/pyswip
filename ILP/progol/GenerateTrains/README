Random train generation		- S. Muggleton, 2/4/1998.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a rig for randomly generating and depicting "Michalski-style"
trains. It contains code used in the ML-challenge of 1994
(see Donald Michie's article in "Computing", in the file "computing.tex",
and the submission to the mllist in file "mllist") in an easily
useable form.

To copy and unpack the software do the following.

i) Copy the files "expand" and "trains.tar.gz" to your filespace.
ii) Run the command "expand". This creates a directory called
	"trains".
iii) Use the command "cd trains" to go into the created directory.

To generate trains, all you need to do is the following.

a) Make sure you have CProgol installed (you can get this
	from ftp.cs.york.ac.uk in pub/ML_GROUP/progol4.4).
b) Put your desired target concept in the file "concept.pl" (comment
	out the present one).
c) Run the command "dorun" (in the directory "trains").
d) Look at the ghostview images (display of the file "train.eps").
e) Look at the randomly generated train descriptions in the files
	"learn.pl" and "train1.pl".
f) Iterate from c). You should get a different set of randomly
	generated trains each time.

If you want to vary the number of trains randomly generated, then
change the number in the following line in file "in".

	make(20,train)?

The command "dorun" does the following.

1. Generates 20 random trains.
2. Classifies them according to the concept definition in concept.pl.
	This generates P positive and N negative examples of eastbound trains.
3. Equalises the number of pos/neg examples to min(P,N) and
	writes them as a Progol input file in train1.pl. Mode
	declarations for this file are learn.pl.
4. Draws the trains in train.pl. Uses the drawing programs based on
	the postscript generation predicates in ps.pl.
5. Runs ghostview to display the trains.
6. Runs Progol on learn.pl.

One difference from the ML-challenge code of 1994 is that the
trains are generated in both list form (the file "train.pl")
and as a set of individual facts about carriages etc. ( in "train1.pl").
