Progol source code and examples (11.9.95)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Contained in this directory is the
source code, manual and examples for the Inductive Logic
Programming system Progol (Version 4.1). Progol4.1 is now
available for general distribution. Progol is fully
described in the paper ``Inverse entailment and Progol''
by Stephen Muggleton which appears in New Generation Computing
Journal, Vol. 13, pp. 245-286. This paper is available
as gzipped Postscript by anonymous ftp from
ftp.comlab.ox.ac.uk in file pub/Packages/ILP/Papers/InvEnt.ps.gz.
Progol is freely available for academic research.
Progol is also available under license for commercial
research. To apply for such a license, please write
to steve@comlab.ox.ac.uk.

In addition to the man pages for Progol4.1
there are 3 typescript files containing the output of Progol
running on the animals example files to show you how
Progol is operated. Having followed these you should be able
to run Progol on the other demonstration examples. The example
files also contain comments.

To get hold of Progol4.1 use get in ftp to copy the following
files to your directory.

	progol4_1.tar.gz
	expand

Now do the following shell command:

$ expand

This should produce the subdirectories, `examples', `source' and `man'
and complile progol in subdirectory `man'.

Include progol's source directory in your
.login file path entry to allow you to use progol as a command.
Remember to source your .login file before continuing.
Next read the script files and try running Progol.

$ cd ../examples
$ more animals.sc1
$ more animals.sc2
$ more animals.sc3
$ progol animals
$ progol arch
$ ...

Try running Progol on all of the examples and see what happens.

Next have a look at the Progol manual pages. This can be done
as follows.

$ cd ../man
$ nroff -man advise.1 | more
$ ...

Have fun!
