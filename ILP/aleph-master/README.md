## Introduction

Porting of Aleph for SWI-Prolog.

Aleph is an Inductive Logic Programming system developed by [Ashwin Srinivasan](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ashwin/profile):

[http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/machlearn/Aleph/](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/machlearn/Aleph/)

This pack contains a porting of Aleph v.5 to SWI-Prolog. The porting was done by [Fabrizio Riguzzi](http://ml.unife.it/fabrizio-riguzzi/).

Two files are included: `aleph_orig.pl` is a direct porting of Aleph for Yap, while `aleph.pl` is modoule-file that can run also under SWISH.
`aleph.pl` was developed by Paolo Niccol√≤ Giubelli  and Fabrizio Riguzzi.


## Usage
`aleph_orig.pl` can be used as the original Aleph.

`aleph.pl` differs because it uses a single input file instead of three files for background, positive and negative examples.

The input file for `aleph.pl` must be structured as follows:

### 1. Module loading
```
:- use_module(library(aleph)).
```
### 2. Aleph initialization
```
:- aleph.
```
### 3. Directives
Nothing has changed here, you can use `modeh/2`, `modeb/2`, `determination/2` as documented in the [manual](#manual) except that `set/2` and `setting/2` are replaced by `aleph_set/2` and 
   `aleph_setting/2`. E.g.:
```
:- modeh(*,grandparent(+person,-person)).
:- modeh(*,parent(+person,-person)).

:- modeb(*,mother(+person,-person)).
:- modeb(*,father(+person,-person)).
:- modeb(*,parent(+person,-person)).

:- aleph_set(verbose,1).

% ...
```
### 4. Background Knowledge Section
Nothing has changed here except you need to enclose this section with `begin_bg/0` and `end_bg/0` directives. Between them you can put your background clauses. E.g.:
```
:- begin_bg.
person(bob).
person(dad(bob)).
% ...
:- end_bg.
```
### 5. Positive Examples Section
The positive examples section is delimited by `begin_in_pos/0` and `end_in_pos/0` directives. E.g.:
```
:- begin_in_pos.
grandparent(dad(dad(bob)),bob).
grandparent(dad(mum(bob)),bob).
% ...
:- end_in_pos.
```
### 6. Negative Examples Section
The negative examples section is delimited by `begin_in_neg/0` and `end_in_neg/0` directives. E.g.:
```
:- begin_in_neg.
grandparent(bob,bob). % bob is not a grandparent of bob
% ...
:- end_in_neg.
```

## New induction commands

You can use the usual Aleph commands for performing learning.
   Moreover, the following predicates were added. 
   Their arity has been increased by one compared to the original version. 
   The (new) output argument returns the result of the command.


- `induce(-Program)`
- `induce_tree(-Program)`
- `induce_cover(-Program)`
- `induce_modes(-Modes)`
- `induce_incremental(-Program)`
- `induce_max(-Program)`
- `induce_features(-Features)`
- `induce_constraints(-Constraints)`
- `induce_theory(-Program)`
- `induce_clauses(-Program)`
- `covers(-Ex)`
- `coversn(-Ex)`
- `reduce(-Cl)`
- `addgcws(-Cl)`
- `good_clauses(-Cls)`
